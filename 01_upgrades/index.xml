      <description>The provided Squeak 5.1 Image causes problems when loading projects due to the following circumstances:
 Squeak 3 has a #Project class. Squeak 5 has a #Project class, which has become a super class of different kinds of Projects (such as #MVCProject and #MorphicProject). The Squeak 3 #Project has been superseded by #MorphicProject in Squeak 5. As such a rename has been introduced in SmartRefStream&amp;gt;&amp;gt;initKnownRenames. This rename however was not applied consistently, causing different code paths to work with different names, inevitably leading to an error condition (&amp;rdquo;Error: class not in structures list&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <description>While loading a project, an error occured in TextStyle&amp;gt;&amp;gt;addNewFontSize: because a fontArray contained a TTCFontSet along with TTCFonts. As such an extra check was introduced to ignore objects which are not instances of TTCFont.</description>
